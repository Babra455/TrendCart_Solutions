## Datasets 

**Patients.csv ** -  This dataset contains transactional and customer data with columns including transaction_id, sales_date, sales_time, cogs, customer_id, gender, age, category, quantity, price_per_unit, and total_sale. It provides information on sales performance, product profitability, and customer behavior, enabling analysis of revenue trends, purchasing patterns, and key drivers of business performance.

## Dashboard Features 
Although a visual dashboard was not created, the SQL analysis provides key insights that could be displayed on one. These include total sales and revenue trends, customer distribution by gender and age, top-selling product categories, profitability metrics such as cogs and gross margin, and transaction patterns over time. These insights help identify high-performing products, peak sales periods, and opportunities to improve overall business performance.

## Key Findings
1.	Revenue and profit show strong seasonal trends, peaking during the months of September to December each year, with December 2024 recording the highest overall performance, indicating significant end-of-year demand.
2.	Revenue and profit show strong seasonal trends, peaking during the months of September to December each year, with December 2024 recording the highest overall performance, indicating significant end-of-year demand
3.	The product categories of Clothing, Electronics, and Beauty consistently outperform others in both revenue and profit, while maintaining high profit margins, highlighting these categories as key drivers of business performance.
4.	Female customers generate slightly higher revenue overall, whereas male customers deliver marginally higher profit, showing that purchasing value is relatively similar across genders.
5.	Small bundle purchases account for the highest transaction volumes and contribute the most to profitability, making bundled products an important focus for sales and marketing strategies.

## Recommendations 
1.	Target the most valuable customers—those with the highest transaction counts and revenue—through loyalty programs, personalized offers, and priority support to improve retention and drive repeat purchases.
2.	Align staffing, inventory, and promotional activities with peak months (e.g., September–December) to maximize sales and profit. Introduce off-season promotions to boost performance during slower months like January–March.
3.	Tailor marketing campaigns to high-value age groups, particularly customers aged 50+, who contribute the most revenue and profit. Consider targeted promotions for other profitable segments, such as customers aged 30–49, to increase engagement.
4.	Focus on promoting and expanding bundled offerings through targeted pricing and marketing to boost sales frequency and profitability.
5.	Allocate more marketing and inventory resources to Clothing, Electronics, and Beauty, as they consistently generate the highest revenue and profit. Consolidate minor or duplicate category entries to maintain clean, actionable data.
6.	Continue prioritizing products and categories with strong profit margins, such as Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty. Review lower-margin items and consider adjusting pricing, reducing costs, or discontinuing underperforming products to maximize overall profitability.
